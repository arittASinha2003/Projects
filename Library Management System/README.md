# Library Management System

This Python program implements a basic Library Management System. It allows users to perform various operations such as adding books, removing books, lending books, returning books, searching books by title, author, or genre, listing available books, listing overdue books, and showing active users. The program interacts with the MySQL database to store information about users, books, and issued books.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 above installed on the system. [Link](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- MySQL Workbench installed and running. [Link](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)
- Required Python packages: mysql-connector-python, tabulate, python-dotenv
- A database named ```library``` in MySQL. You can create a database by running:
```
create database library
```

## Package Installation

Install the required packages to run this program

1 : MySQL Connector for Python (mysql-connector-python):

```python
pip install mysql-connector-python
```

This package allows Python programs to connect to MySQL databases and interact with them using SQL queries. It's an essential tool for working with MySQL databases from within Python applications.

2 : Tabulate:

```python
pip install tabulate
```

This package provides a convenient way to format tabular data in Python. It can convert lists of dictionaries or lists of lists into nicely formatted tables, which can be printed to the console or included in reports or documents.

3 : Python-dotenv:

```python
pip install python-dotenv
```

This package allows Python application to read key-value pairs from a .env file and add them to the environment variables.

## Setting Up .env File

Modify the below details as per your needs.

```
host = localhost
user = root
password = XXXX
database = library
```

## Usage

For running the program, follow these steps:

1 : First run the ```Setup.py``` file:

```python
python3 Setup.py
```

2 : Then, run the ```Main.py``` file:

```python
python3 Main.py
```

3 : Follow the on-screen menu to perform various operations.

## Features

- Add Book: Add a new book to the library database.
- Remove Book: Remove an existing book from the library database.
- Lend Book: Lend a book to a user. Checks if the user exists, if not, registers the user. Checks if the maximum limit of 3 books per user is reached.
- Return Book: Return a book that was previously lent. Updates the book availability and user's issued book count.
- Search Book: Search all books either by title, author, or genre.
- List Available Books: Display a list of books that are currently available in the library.
- List Issued Books: Display a list of books that are currently issued.
- List Overdue Books: Display a list of books that are overdue, along with user information.
- Show Active Users: Display a list of users who have currently lent books.
- Exit: Terminate the program.

## Database Table Structures

There are three tables present in the database:

- users: Contains information about library users.
  - id (INT, Primary Key): User ID
  - name (VARCHAR): User name
  - email (VARCHAR, Unique): User email
  - issued_book_count (INT): Count of books currently issued to the user

- books: Contains information about books available in the library.
  - id (INT, Primary Key): Book ID
  - title (VARCHAR): Title of the book
  - author (VARCHAR): Author of the book
  - genre (VARCHAR): Genre of the book
  - available (BOOLEAN): Availability status of the book
  - user_id (INT, Foreign Key): ID of the user to whom the book is currently lent (NULL if available)

- issuedbooks: Tracks books that are currently issued.
  - sno (INT, Auto Increment, Primary Key): Serial Number
  - book_id (INT, Foreign Key): Book ID
  - issued_book_title (VARCHAR): Title of the issued book
  - user_id (INT, Foreign Key): ID of the user to whom the book is issued
  - issue_date (DATE): Date when the book was issued
  - due_date (DATE): Due date for returning the book
