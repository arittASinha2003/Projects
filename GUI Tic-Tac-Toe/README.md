# Tic Tac Toe GUI

## Overview

The Tic Tac Toe GUI is a Java-based graphical application that allows two players to play the classic game of Tic Tac Toe on a 3x3 grid. The application uses Java Swing for the user interface and implements the game logic to determine the winner or if the game results in a tie.

## Features

- Interactive Grid: A 3x3 grid of buttons where players can click to place their marks (X or O).
- Player Switching: The application alternates between two players after each move.
- Win and Tie Detection: The application checks for winning conditions after each move and announces the winner or if the game is a tie.
- Reset Functionality: The ability to reset the board for a new game.

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 8 or higher).
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any text editor to run Java applications.
